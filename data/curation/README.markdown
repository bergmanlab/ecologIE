Grepped Ecology subset of multispecies_interactions.tsv. 
Created two new columns "Good Data" and "Notes". 
For each sentence two curators (Casey Bergman and Jenny Rowntree) evaluated each sentence jointly to determine if the sentiment of sentence could be correctly inferred from species and interaction tags. 
200 sentences evaluated on 10 Aug 2012. 
If any of the species interacted in the correct manner as any of the interaction terms then Good Data = Y, else Good Data = N. 
For Good Data == N, we categorized errors into five classes:
- interaction trigger problem
- missing interaction
- missing participant
- species list
- species trigger problem
