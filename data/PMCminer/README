Data from Springate and Bergman 2012 (forthcoming):
An exploration of mining species interaction data from the ecology literature.


This directory contains:

dict-community-ecology-interactions.tsv - dictionary of ecological interaction terms used
to tag articles.

DOI_lists:
- files containing a list of doi codes downloaded from the PLoS API.  
They reference all articles in PLoS One for the following subject categories:
    - ecology
    - Molecular biology
    - Genomics
    - Biochemistry
The lists of dois were downloaded on 28/9/2011

analysis:
- the output files from a run of ecologIE/PCminer, based on a complete archive 
of PLoS One articles downloaded via FTP from the PMC OASS on 29/9/2011.  
- includes:
    - all_interactions.csv - a flatfile of every putative  ecological interaction term
    found by the Linnaeus tagger in all  subject corpora.  Includes 
    subject, article file name, doi, interaction id (from interaction dictionary),
    interaction term (as found in the article), the sentence in which the term was found.
    - interactions_per_article.csv - Counts of the number of interactions found in all articles
    in each corpus.
    - multispecies_interactions.csv - flatfile of all putative multispecies interactions 
    found in all corpora. Putative multispecies interactions are classified as a tagged 
    ecological interaction term in the same sentence as two different tagged species. 
    Includes subject, article file name, doi, species id (from database), species name,
    interaction id, interaction name, sentence.
    - multispp_interactions_table.csv - table of 0/1 (absence/presence) of multispp-
    interactions of each category for all articles in all corpora
     - spp_numbers_ambig.csv - the total number of tagged  species per subject corpus
     and the percentage with ambiguous species tags (i.e. matched > 1 spp)
     - spp_numbers_unambig.csv - frequencies of all unambiguous species in each
     subject corpus.
     - spp_per_article.csv - number of unique species tags in each article in each
     subject corpus.
     - SummaryStats.csv - table of summary statistics for each subject corpus.
     that have ambiguous species tags.

Not included (lots of files/big files):
    - archived PLoS One article files
    - corpora of article bodies for each subject
    - species dictionary
    - Linnaeus output files
