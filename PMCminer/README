EcologIE PMCMiner  - Tools for extracting putative multispecies interaction data from articles in the Pubmed Open Access Subset.
V.0.1 (22/Feb/2012)

David A. Springate and Casey Bergman, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester

Includes a Python wrapper for the Linnaeus entity recognition tool (http://linnaeus.sourceforge.net/).

The pmcminer.py file is the main executable to replicate the analyses in Springate and Bergman 2012 (forthcoming).  
To do this you need:
A directory containing the PLoSONE XML archive
A set of DOIs from the PLoS API
A working copy of Linnaeus
Species names dictionary
Ecological Interaction terms dictionary
Python 2.7 (It may work on earlier versions but is untested)
The following Python libraries:
lxml
nltk with punkt tokeniser from nltk.data
numpy
scipy
 
 Running pmcminer.py  should find articles matching DOIs,  extract and tokenise article bodies,  match species and interaction terms using Linnaeus, build tables of sentences containing putative multispecies interactions and various other summary tables presented in the paper.

The tools are designed to be modular and pluggable to facilitate use in other projects. 
All directory and path logic is in settings.py in the control folder.


For questions, suggestions or bug reports, please contact David Springate:

To do:
Upload script for downloading DOIs from PLoS API
Upload species and ecological interactions databases
Upload R analysis scripts for Springate & Bergman 2012 paper.
Fix the horrible hack that allows the diversity function to work.
